The study of algorithms and data structures is one of the foundations of
computer science, a rich field elegant techniques and sophisticated
mathematical analyses. And it's more than just fun and games for the
theoretically inclined: a good algroithm or data structure might make it
possible to solve a problem in seconds that could otherwise take years.

In specialized areas like graphics, databases, parsing, numerical analysis,
and simulation, the ability to solve problems depends critically on
state-of-the-artalgorithms and data structures. If you are developing your
programs in a field that's new to you, you \textit{must} find out what is
already known, lest you waste your time doing pooly what others have already
 done well.

Every program depends on algorithms and data structures, but few programs
depend on the invention of brand new ones. Even wihtin an intricate program
like a compiler or a web browser, most of the data structures are arrays,
lists, trees and hash tables. When a program needs something more
elaborate(详细), it will likely be based on these simpler ones.
Accordingly, for most programmers, the task is to know what appropriate
algorithms and data structures are available and to understand how to
choose among alternatives.

Here is the story in a nutshell. There are only a handful of basic
algorithms that show up in almost every program -- primarily searching and
sorting -- and even those are often included in libraries. Similarly,
almost every data structure is derived from a few fundamental ones. Thus
the material covered in this chapter will be familiarityiar to almost all
programmers. We have written working versions to make the discussion
concrete, and you can lift code verbatim if necessary, but do so only after
you have investigated what the programming language and its libraries have
to offer.
